(Sandbox bars feed is sparse vs real-world volumes; filter applied as written in guardrails.md.)

### Scoring (only volume-eligible survivors)

**HPE** — AI data readiness / unified private cloud platforms press release; +5.52% pre-market.
- Catalyst strength: **1** — product/marketing announcement, no contract or revenue delta disclosed. Not a clear cash-flow event.
- Novelty: **2** — fresh, but ~5.5% already moving pre-market.
- Confirmation: **2** — latest daily bar (2026-05-08) closed 29.7→31.33 (+5.5%) on volume 1.69M vs 1.23M 30d avg.
- Cleanliness: **1** — no offsetting news, no earnings within 3 days.
- **Total: 6 — below threshold.**

### Watchlist

| ticker | score | catalyst | source |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|

No tradeable signal today.

Skipped (below threshold or filtered):
- CSCO (catalyst ~9, would-be top pick): 30d avg vol 917k < 1M filter; also novelty ~0 after +14.85% pre-market — move already in.
- NBIS: blowout earnings but stock already +17%, novelty ~0; also fails volume filter.
- ONC: FDA approval (would be high catalyst strength) but 30d avg vol 13k — far below liquidity floor.
- BIIB: positive Phase 2 CELIA data, fails volume filter (60k).
- SATS: $40B FCC spectrum approval, fails volume filter (278k).
- AKAM: Q1 beat, fails volume filter (256k).
- HPE: only volume-eligible survivor, but catalyst too soft (product PR, no numbers) → score 6.

Action items for operator:
- Volume filter at 1M shares against the current sandbox bars feed eliminates almost every real large-cap. Consider either (a) lowering `min_avg_daily_volume_shares` in guardrails.md to match the data source (~250k looks closer to "liquid" in this feed), or (b) wiring a real-volume data source. Leaving guardrails.md alone for now — pre-market.md is forbidden from editing it.
- CSCO is the cleanest fundamental catalyst (beat + raise) but the novelty is already gone after the +14.85% pre-market gap. Strategy correctly excludes it on novelty grounds, independent of the volume filter.
