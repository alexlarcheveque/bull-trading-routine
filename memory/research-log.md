# research-log.md
# Append-only. One block per research pass or notable event.
# Pre-market.md writes a daily watchlist block. Preflight-check.sh appends a
# rejection block whenever an order is blocked. Halt events get a marker.

## 2026-05-13 seed
Initial empty log. First watchlist will be appended by pre-market.md on the next
6:00 AM CT run. Preflight smoke-test entries from setup were intentionally
discarded.

## 2026-05-14T00:11:01Z market-open SKIPPED
- alpaca clock: is_open=false, next_open=2026-05-14T09:30:00-04:00

- no exits, no entries, no portfolio refresh
- no pre-market watchlist exists yet for today; pre-market.md has not run

## 2026-05-14 pre-market watchlist

Research pass FAILED: xAI Grok API returned permission/credits error on all 4 queries.
Response body: `{"code":"The caller does not have permission to execute the specified operation","error":"Your newly created team doesn't have any credits or licenses yet. You can purchase those on https://console.x.ai/team/2f47388e-3bd1-4c11-958e-cb40e1715c7b."}`

No tradeable signal today. Market-open will see no watchlist and sit out.

Action item for operator: top up xAI credits at console.x.ai before the next pre-market run, or swap `scripts/grok.sh` to a working news source.
